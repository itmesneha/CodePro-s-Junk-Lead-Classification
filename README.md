It used the money to increase its brand awareness. As the marketing spend increased, it got several leads from different sources. Although it had spent significant money on acquiring customers, it had to be profitable in the long run to sustain the business. 
The major cost that the company is incurring is the customer acquisition cost (CAC). Now, we will discuss what customer acquisition means.
At the initial stage, customer acquisition cost is required to be high in companies. But as their businesses grow, these companies start focussing on profitability. Many companies first offer their services for free or provide offers at the initial stages but later start charging customers for these services. For example, Google Pay used to provide many offers, and Reliance Jio in India offered free mobile data services for over a year. Once these brands were established and brand awareness was generated, these businesses started growing organically. At this point, they began charging customers.
Businesses want to reduce their customer acquisition costs in the long run. There are many ways to do that. This porject focuses on models used for lead scoring.
